Instructions: 
1. Take a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil in it
2.  Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown
3.  Then take them out on a plate and set aside
4. \r\nTo the same pot, add the chopped garlic and saut\u00e9 for a minute
5.  Then add the chopped tomatoes and cook until tomatoes turn soft
